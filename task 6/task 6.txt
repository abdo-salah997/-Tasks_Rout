Lec 7:
1- create a Login Form with inputs [email - password] and check if email and password exists in static data in an array, using class and function.

2- create Registration form with input [email - password - repassword], and email format should be correct and password matched re-password, if the validation is done add user data in users array and display it in table.

3- create form to get 5 subject degree to calculate student result, so u will check if subject degree bigger than or equal 50 u will push it in new array, and if subject degree less than 50 u will push it in different array and show result table.
ex: subject_1 = 30, subject_2 = 50, subject_3=90, subject_4 =10, subject_5= 100.
successful_subjects = [50,90,100].
fails_subjects = [30,10].
------------------------
subjects result | status 
------------------------
50                     | successful
90                     | successful
100                    | successful
30                     | failed
10                     | failed
Note: the solution must be with class and functions.
